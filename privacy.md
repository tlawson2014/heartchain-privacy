Last updated: 2025-05-26

HeartChain (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the information you provide when using HeartChain on Android.
1. Information We Collect

a. Personal Data

    Authentication: When you sign in with Google, we collect your Google user ID and display name to manage your account.

    Reflections & Logs: Your kindness logs and reflections (text and timestamps) are stored in Firebase Firestore under your user ID.

b. Analytics & Usage Data

    Firebase Analytics: We collect anonymized events (e.g. log_kindness, save_reflection, screen views) to understand app usage, improve features, and measure retention. No personally identifying information is sent.

c. Advertising Data

    AdMob: We show banner and interstitial ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage signals in accordance with their privacy policy.

2. How We Use Your Data

    Core Functionality: To authenticate you, save and retrieve your logs and reflections, and display them in the app.

    Analytics & Improvement: To measure feature usage, diagnose crashes, and prioritize enhancements.

    Advertising: To serve relevant ads and generate revenue to support app development.

3. Consent

Before any data collection for analytics or ad serving, you will be prompted to review and agree to this Privacy Policy. If you decline, HeartChain will run in a limited “read-only” mode without analytics or ads.
4. Data Sharing & Disclosure

    Service Providers: We use Firebase (Google) and AdMob (Google) as our backend and ad partners. They may process data on our behalf but are bound by their own privacy commitments.

    Legal Requirements: We may disclose your data if required by law or to protect our rights.

5. Data Retention & Deletion

    Account Data: Your logs and reflections are retained until you delete your account or request deletion.

    Deletion Request: To have your data removed, please email us at lettersbyt2025@gmail.com  with “Data Deletion Request” in the subject line. We will purge your personal data within 30 days.

6. Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit, access controls) to safeguard your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
7. Children’s Privacy

HeartChain is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have, please contact us to have it removed.
8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We’ll post the new version here and update the “Last updated” date. Significant changes will be communicated in-app.
